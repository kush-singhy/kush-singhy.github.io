# And They All Lived Happily Ever After

Hi!

I wanted to try writing blog posts because I read books sometimes and tend to bore my friends to death by talking about random topics that I find interesting. I thought that writing about them might provide a similar level of catharsis, so here we are. Plus, I’ve heard people say that writing a blog can lead you to places you never imagined and I would like to be in places I’ve never imagined.

To start off, I wanted to write about a chapter from the book Sapiens that really struck a chord with me and is arguably the most important chapter from the book (in my opinion). That chapter is *Chapter 19 - And They Lived Happily Ever After*.

For some context, Sapiens is book written by Yuval Noah Harari about the history of humankind, beginning from 70,000 years ago with hunter gatherers and slowly progressing through each major historical period until today. Every single chapter of this book is informative and eye-opening but this specific chapter hit me like a truck and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since. That’s because there’s one thing that I imagine a lot of people, including myself, have not considered when thinking about the exponential progression of society, science, technology, and humankind as a whole. 

Are we any ***happier*** than we used to be? 

Have the major revolutions in history (cognitive, agricultural, scientific and industrial) resulted in us being any happier than our distant hunter-gatherer ancestors? Has the convenience of modern day life, our greater understanding of science, or watching YouTube while eating food increased our sense of contentment?  This is an important consideration because it begs the question of why we even ended up here, and it might open an even deeper rabbit hole about our purpose in the universe (which I’m not nearly qualified enough to get into). Even more importantly, this question might even give us an insight into how we *can* be happier in our day to day lives. 

You might think that this is a silly question considering factors like the advancement of modern medicine, the decrease in child mortality, famine and war, and globalisation bringing us closer to people around the world. And yes, if we consider happiness as a combination of material factors such as wealth and health, then we would in fact be significantly happier now than a medieval peasant was. However, the fact of the matter is that happiness is not a direct result of our objective conditions. Rather,

> *Happiness is the **correlation** between objective conditions and subjective expectations*
> 

This one single quote from this chapter is what changed my entire perspective on the matter. When I took a minute to really process this I began to realise that maybe our modern society isn’t optimised for our happiness. For starters, the amount of uninhibited access we have to a filtered version of other peoples lives through social media only serve to increase our expectations of our own lives. On top of that, we are constantly surrounded by highly optimised advertisements that once again make us feel as though our own lives are inadequate in an attempt to make us purchase the product in question. Looking through a historical lens, the objective conditions of our distant ancestors may have been worse, but their expectations of reality were also much lower. As a result their happiness may have been the same or better than ours today. As Yuval put it: “When things improve, expectations balloon, and consequently even dramatic improvements in objective conditions can leave us dissatisfied”. 

My takeaway from all of this is that we may or may not be happier than the homo sapiens of the past, and at the end of the day our happiness is in our own hands. I aspire to be grateful for my situation each and every day, and in doing so, not allow my surroundings to balloon my expectations beyond my objective reality. 

Yuval goes into a lot more depth about measuring happiness, the biology of happiness and different philosophies regarding the topic, and I would highly recommend that you read this chapter (and the whole book if you have time).

I wanted to end with an idea I got from James Clear’s newsletter - by sharing two of my favourite quotes from the week: 

> *“Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbour’s roof, when your own doorstep is unclean.”* - Confucius

> *“It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem.”* - Marcus Aurelius

Thanks for reading :)
