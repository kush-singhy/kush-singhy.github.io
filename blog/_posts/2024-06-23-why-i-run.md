I got a huge blister under my foot after one of my runs last week and it still hasn’t fully recovered. Since I haven’t been able to run in a week I thought I’d just write about it instead, and in this blog I want to try and answer the following question for myself: Why do I run? I’ve been running on and off for a long time and this year is the most serious I’ve ever taken it. I want to dig in and understand the true reasons why I run so that I can use my answers as a reminder for whenever it gets tough (which is quite often). 

I’ll start with something that probably **isn’t** a reason. For a bit of context, I had never been naturally athletic throughout my childhood, having a poor physique and not being exceptional at any sports. In my late teens I began lifting weights and before every weight lifting session I would force myself to hop on the treadmill because I desperately wanted to lose weight. By the end of my first year of this I had technically achieved that goal but I realised that I hadn’t put on any muscle, so I stopped running completely and purely focused on lifting and diet. Running was never intrinsically enjoyable for me at that time and it was purely a means to burn calories. Since then I tried getting back into running a few times but never really stuck to it or took it seriously because I was able to achieve my aesthetic goals without it. So we can rule out body composition as one of the reasons why I run. 

Fast forward to last year; I began running again, but this time I felt different about it. Since it wasn’t necessary for any aesthetic goals of mine I went into it without any expectations or attachments to any end outcomes. One thing that became obvious to me is that I enjoyed running outdoors significantly more than I did running on the treadmill. This brings me to my first ‘why’: 

**Running gives me an avenue to be outside in nature.** 

It’s a period of time where I can breathe in fresh air, allow my eyes to relax and soak in a significant amount of vitamin D from the sun. A lot of my other activities are predominantly indoors, including studying, work, reading & lifting weights, and running just gives me more of an opportunity to reap the benefits of being outdoors. 

I started my latest stint of running with the intention of training for a 5K and hitting a specific time goal (of 25 minutes). This was a great motivator to get started and after a couple months of training I managed to accomplish that goal (woohoo!). After that I felt that I wanted to push myself even harder, but not in terms of speed. Rather, in terms of distance. Next thing I knew I had signed up for a half-marathon and began a training plan on the Nike Run Club app. This training plan would gradually increase the length of my runs every week and I always found myself looking forward to these longer runs no matter how difficult the previous one was. It started with 8km, then 12, then 16 and my most recent run was 20km. 

**I think what really drew me to long distance running was the mental adaptations.** 

I’m of the firm belief that after you have reached a certain level of physical fitness, running is more of a mental game than a physical one. If you can put one foot in front of the other, you can keep running. The only thing stopping you are the limitations you have placed on yourself in your mind and there is something about breaking these mental barriers that I find extremely attractive. 

Additionally, it is important to maintain focus throughout the entire duration of these long runs, which becomes more and more difficult as your body starts to get tired. Maintaining focus means keeping your composure, ensuring correct running form and controlling your breathing. All of these aspects are crucial to completing these longer runs, and if you begin to slack off you will find yourself struggling a lot more than you need to. I find that this mental resilience translates to other areas of my life, allowing me to maintain focus for longer and tackle difficult challenges with a more positive mindset. 

I also wanted to touch on the idea of social validation. I had this thought recently about whether I would still be running if I wasn’t able to share my achievements with other people. The feeling of telling my friends about my latest run or posting personal milestones on Instagram definitely gives me a hit of dopamine, but is it a strong enough reason to keep running? For now I’d say that it’s simply an external motivator that I can draw on to complete difficult runs, but I wouldn’t say it’s an underlying reason for why I do it. 

In a similar vein, I’d like to highlight the runners high. Runner’s high is this rush of endorphins that you can get after completing a really challenging run and it is very addictive. Once again, this is a nice external motivator but I wouldn’t consider it an underlying reason for running. 

Here’s what I can gather from this self-analysis. The primary reasons why I run are reasons that are tied to the process of running itself; namely being outdoors and building mental resilience. There are external reasons as well, such as achieving a certain distance or time, getting social validation or feeling runner’s high, but these are simply by-products of focusing on the process. Ultimately it is the intrinsic, process-driven motivators that really stick. I really like this outlook and I think it is why I have taken it so seriously this time around. 

I wanted to share my latest run as well (the one that gave me the blister):
