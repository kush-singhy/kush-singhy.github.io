I was recently gifted Ali Abdaal’s new book ‘Feel Good Productivity’ by a beloved friend of mine, and although there is quite a bit of fluff throughout the book there were some absolute gems of insights that I wanted to break down in this weeks blog. 

One thing you start to realise when you consume a lot of content from books, YouTube, podcasts, or social media, is that the information can get overwhelming very quickly. Although there is a lot of useful information that you know could improve your life, it is almost impossible to apply all of it meaningfully. As we are constantly bombarded by new strategies and hacks our brain is discarding old information at the same rate, and at the end of the day we end up making no change in our lives. 

Ali’s overarching philosophy in this book provides a very simply but effective way to tackle this issue and it is a method that really resonated with me. Each chapter of the book has a general point of discussion which is broken down into ‘experiments’, and I would say that more important than any individual part of this book is this idea of experimentation. We all live very unique lives and it is a known fact that what works for someone else might not work for you. When we are fed information that is intended to improve our lives we are not fully aware of context behind it or the circumstances that the speaker is in, and it is more than likely that our situation is substantially different. Rather than feeling that we NEED to implement every single strategy into our lives, a simple mindset reframe can take a lot of weight off our shoulders and result in more positive growth. 

Think about implementing a new change in life as an experiment. There is absolutely no commitment to it in the long-term, you are simply adding it to your life and observing how it affects you. See how it best fits in your routine and be okay with messing up every once in a while. If over time you see that there is an average improvement in your day to day life then thats awesome! Keep doing it and continue experimenting with ways to sustainably implement it in your life. If it isn’t working for you, then thats still useful information. It gives you a data point that the strategy doesn’t work for you so you don’t have to waste your time trying it again in the future. It also gives you the peace of mind that you at least gave it a shot. By slowly experimenting with different changes and discarding whatever doesn’t work, you will start to see gradual improvements which will compound over time. You will slowly build a life that you are satisfied with, and have the peace of mind that you aren’t missing out on anything. 

This philosophy is something I aspire to implement more actively in the hopes that it will give me a greater bias towards action and ultimately lead to a more fulfilling life. There are more concepts in the book that I would like to discuss in the future, but for now I hope you have taken away something valuable from this post. I would also recommend reading the book for yourself if you are struggling with with low energy, procrastination or a lack of purpose.
