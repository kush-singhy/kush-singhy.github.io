Hey gang. I recently listened to a Chris Williamson podcast with Jim Kwik and I wanted to do something a little interesting this week. I’ll get to that in a second. 

One of the reasons I started this blog is because I want to retain more information that is actually meaningful to me, and I figured that by writing about things that inspire me I’m bound to think more deeply about them and consequently retain them in my memory. So in a sort of meta way, this blog is about improving my (and potentially your) memory. 

The podcast was titled ‘10 Hacks to improve you memory, focus & attention’, all of which are interrelated, and while Jim was explaining his ‘10 hacks’ he used an interesting memorisation technique to ensure it stuck with listeners. He essentially anchored each of the ‘hacks’ (I keep using single quotes because I don’t like the word ‘hack’, I feel like these are important tips) to physical objects in his kitchen and living room. Because humans are able to visualise physical spaces so much more effectively than they are able to retrieve written or verbal language, by anchoring information to places and objects that you are familiar with you are able recall information with ease. 

The interesting thing that I wanted to try is recalling his 10 hacks on improving brain health and memory without referring to the podcast even once. Only by using his visualisation technique. And hopefully you, the reader, will get some useful information out of this as well. Let’s see how I go. 

I enter my kitchen and the first thing I see is my microwave. In a microwave I heat up food, and therefore the first hack is:

- **Nutrition: The right diet will keep you brain healthy and sharp**

Jim lists a few foods that are especially good for brain health, including avocados, blueberries, turmeric and dark chocolate.

Next I turn to my left and see my stovetop. For some reason I have ants on my stovetop. I’m killings ANTS - Automatic negative thoughts. Hack number two is:

- **Kill ANTS (automatic negative thoughts)**

Becoming aware of automatic negative thoughts and actively discarding them from your brain is essential for staying healthy and mentally sharp. 

After cooking ants, I reach for my fridge. The fridge keeps me cool while I’m working out. The next hack is:

- **Physical activity: Working out and staying physically active is important for brain health**

Awesome, now to the left of my fridge is my dishwasher. In my dishwasher I have some supplements. Jim’s next tip is:

- **Supplements and micronutrients: Brain health can be improved by ensuring we get the appropriate nutrients from our diets or supplements.**

Right above my dishwasher is my sink. In my sink sit numerous dishes, all mingling together. Hack number five is:

- **Social connections: Maintaining strong social connections and discussing our learnings will help us retain information better**

Jim also mentions to effectiveness of learning information with the intent of teaching it later on. Even if you are not actually going to teach the information, having this mindset will make you a better learner. 

Now we move out of the kitchen, and the first thing I see is my sliding glass door. I almost walk into it because it’s so clean. Next hack:

- **Clean environment: A clean environment leads to mental clarity and organised thoughts**

Next to my sliding glass door is a heater. The nice warmth of the heater reminds me of a good nights sleep. 

- **Sleep: Getting enough high quality sleep is essential for brain health**

I move over to my china cabinet. Everything is extremely fragile. It needs to be protected. 

- **Protect your brain: Physically protect your brain by wearing helmets and avoiding injuries**

Adjacent to my china cabinet is the couch. I imagine myself sitting there and reading a fascinating book. 

- **Constant Learning: Keep your brain active by constantly learning new things** 

Finally, after making my way through my kitchen and living room, and I take a look at my dining table. I’m not sure what the correlation is here, but it reminds me of Jim Kwik’s final hack for brain health:

- **Mindfulness: Maintain a peaceful mind state by practicing mindfulness.** 

This can be achieved through practices such as meditation, journalling or embracing boredom.

Anddd that brings us to the end of the 10 hacks for improving brain health, memory, attention and focus. I had to work my brain pretty hard to remember those, but by using the visual anchoring technique I was able to get there. I hope you learnt something as well and if you are interested in hearing a more in depth explanation of these I would highly recommend listening to the episode of Modern Wisdom by Chris Williamson with Jim Kwik. 

My personal take on this is that this is a very useful memorisation technique, but only if you need to memorise important information in a very short period of time. I’m still of the belief that the best way to memorise something is to build a fundamental understanding of it and constantly retrieve it from memory. Additionally, doing exercises like this is useful for improving the general capabilities of your brain in the long-run. 

Once again, I’d like to end off with two of my favourite quotes from the week:

> “A shared joy is a double joy, a shared sorrow is a half sorrow” - Swedish Proverb
> 

> “It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable” - Socrates
> 

Cya!
