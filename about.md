Hi, I'm Kush. I like learning new things so I made this page to document stuff that I find interesting. 

I read books 📖, I buy tech 💻, I run long distances 💨, I lift heavy weights 🏋🏽 and I appreciate scenic locations 👀.

Oh, and I studied Computer Science and Actuarial Studies at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).
