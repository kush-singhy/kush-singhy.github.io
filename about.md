Hi, I'm Kush. I like learning new things so I made this page to document stuff that I find interesting. 

I read books, I buy tech, I run long distances, I lift heavy weights and I appreciate scenic locations.

Oh, and I studied Computer Science and Actuarial Studies at [UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).
